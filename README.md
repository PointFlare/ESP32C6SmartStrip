Sharing my hardware PCB design for smart powerstrip as it was requested.
Made some v.9 changes based on initial feedback I received posting pictures online.


It's one of my first PCB Projects, so was mainly used to learn as well as get a better understanding of KiCad.
I'm sure there is plenty to improve. So, I welcome anyone to do so. But please share your upgrades. Love to hear what you did.

Baseline features:
- Power conversion onboard: Single plug into main outlet
- Control each plug seprately: Star configuration
- Easy ESP: Off-the-shelf ESP
- Replaceable: ESP in case of failure (I've blown a few in my time)
- Safety: Glass fuse on each outlet
- All THT components: anyone can make this with basic equipment

Software:
Currently running ESPhome firmware. No custom firmware jobs. ESPhome integrates well into my Home Assistant environment.
